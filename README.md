Playing around with a CHIP8 Emulator

This is a CHIP8 emulator written in C#. I would like to think that the code is somehow well documented so anybody can understand what's going on. But do let me know if something is unclear

It has a disassembler and a graphical debugger 

Feel free to contribute, question, critic and question my code :)
